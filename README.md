# Twitter Scraper

In this project I was scraping data from twitter to try and figure out
what companies particular angel investors are intrested in. In this repo
I thought it would be fun to see what it is like to build the entire web
app without a framework, just to see what the complexity was like. It got
really gross really fast, and I decided to just scrap it and use Django to
put everything together. That is in a different repo currently.
